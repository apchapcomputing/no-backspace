# No Backspace


**Write without editing. Type without interrupting. Think without censoring.**

When you write with a pen and paper, your hand moves at the speed of thought. Words flow onto the page in a continuous stream. You can't instantly erase them, so you don't. You keep moving forward, following ideas wherever they lead.

But when you type? Everything changes.

The backspace key sits there, always tempting. A word feels wrong, so you delete it. A sentence doesn't land perfectly, so you rewrite it. An idea seems half-baked, so you erase it before it's fully formed. You're editing before you've finished thinking.

The result? You're not writing. You're not drafting. You're trapped in a cycle of creation and destruction, never letting your thoughts breathe long enough to discover where they actually want to go.

Studies show that constant self-editing during the drafting phase:

- Interrupts creative flow and breaks concentration
- Filters out unconventional ideas before they can develop
- Increases writing anxiety and perfectionism
- Dramatically slows down the drafting process
- Leads to safer, less original writing

The best writers know the truth: writing and editing are different processes. You can't do both at once.

No Backspace (No BS) remove the backspace and delete keys entirely while you write. No second-guessing. No erasure. No breaking your flow to fix something you'll revise later anyway.

Just pure, forward momentum.

Write your messy first draft with the confidence that every idea will make it onto the page. You can edit it out later. Right now, you write.

Without the comfort of deletion, you commit to your thoughts. You finish sentences you would have abandoned. You discover ideas hiding behind the ones you would have backspaced.

You write faster. You write stranger. You write more honestly.

And when you're done, you have a real draftâ€”messy, imperfect, and full of possibility. Now you can edit. Now you can refine. But first, you had to write.

Separate creation from criticism. Write without the BS.
